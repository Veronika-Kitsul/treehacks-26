treehacks 2026



if we want to build ai-based security and vulnerability scanner for github repos, do you think that's a very cool project and waht tracks can we possibly qualify for?

Yes — that’s a very strong hackathon idea if you execute it sharply.

Given both of you:

Systems + networking + security background

ML + infra interests

Startup instincts

Veronika leaning toward systems / networking / security

You thinking about infrastructure-level AI

This is aligned.

Now let’s break it down strategically.

🔥 Is it cool?

Yes — if you avoid “another wrapper around static analysis.”

Not cool:

GPT that reads repo and says “looks insecure”

Regex-based vulnerability search

Just calling npm audit and summarizing

Cool:

AI that reasons across files

Detects architectural vulnerabilities

Understands authentication flows

Finds insecure trust boundaries

Detects secrets + dangerous patterns + infra misconfigs

Cross-repo attack surface modeling

Explains exploit chain step-by-step

Suggests minimal diff patch

Even cooler:

Combine static + LLM reasoning

Generate proof-of-concept exploit

Score exploitability, not just severity

Continuous scanning bot via GitHub App

That becomes real.

🏆 What prizes you could target

Let’s go through TreeHacks categories:

1️⃣ AI Grand Prize

Very realistic if:

Core innovation is AI reasoning

Not just tool aggregation

You show intelligent exploit chain modeling

This is your strongest general category.

2️⃣ Cloud AI Grand Prize

If:

You deploy as scalable GitHub App

Use cloud inference

Real-time scanning

CI/CD integration

If infra is solid → yes.

3️⃣ Edge AI Grand Prize

Not likely unless you:

Run model locally

Build on-device scanner

Show lightweight model optimized for edge

Probably not your best bet.

4️⃣ Inference Grand Prize

If you:

Optimize inference cost

Do smart chunking

Custom retrieval over repo

Caching embeddings

Fast scanning of large codebases

If you show systems-level efficiency → strong.

Given your systems background, this could be powerful.

5️⃣ Most Technically Complex

Very viable.

If you:

Build full repo graph

Parse AST

Build call graph

Use LLM to reason over graph

Detect multi-step vulnerability chains

Judges love complexity if demo is clear.

6️⃣ Most Impactful Hack

Security tools are always impactful.

Frame it as:

“Every repo is a potential attack surface. We built an AI that reasons about vulnerabilities like a red-team engineer.”

That plays very well.

7️⃣ Best Hardware Hack

No.

8️⃣ YC x TreeHacks Challenge

Very viable.

YC LOVES:

Developer tools

GitHub integrations

Security infra

AI + infra

If you pitch it like:

“AI-powered continuous security engineer for every startup.”

This fits YC vibes extremely well.

🎯 Strategic Track Targeting

Best realistic targets:

AI Grand Prize

Most Technically Complex

Most Impactful

YC Challenge

Inference Grand Prize

That’s already 5 possible categories.

💡 How to Make It Win-Worthy

To elevate it beyond “another AI tool”:

1️⃣ Don’t just detect vulnerabilities — model exploit chains

Example:

File A → unsafe deserialization

File B → exposed endpoint

Missing auth layer

Chain leads to remote code execution

If your demo shows:

“Here is the exploit path. Here is the patch diff.”

That’s elite.

2️⃣ Use structural understanding

Build:

Repo graph

Dependency graph

API surface map

Trust boundary detection

LLM reasons over graph.

That’s technically impressive.

3️⃣ Show live demo

Demo flow:

Paste GitHub repo

It scans

Generates:

Vulnerability list

Exploit chain

Risk score

Patch suggestion

Maybe auto-create PR

Judges LOVE visible action.

4️⃣ Add surprise factor

Examples:

“Red-team mode” where it generates attack payload

“Defense mode” where it rewrites code

Visual attack graph

Slack bot that alerts you

🧠 Is it too common?

Security + AI is common.

But exploit-chain reasoning across full repo is not common.

Most tools:

Lint-level

Static pattern matching

CVE lookup

Secret scanning

Few tools reason semantically across files.

That’s your differentiation.

🏁 Verdict

Yes, it’s a strong hackathon project.

It aligns with:

Systems

Security

AI

Infra

YC-style thinking

Real startup potential

If executed well, it can compete for:

AI Grand Prize

Most Technically Complex

YC challenge

Impact prize

If you want, next we can:

Design the minimal MVP architecture for 36 hours

Decide stack (Rust backend? Python? FastAPI?)

Design demo flow optimized for judges

Or brainstorm a sharper name + positioning

What direction do you want to take this?

these are all the prizes --

Okay.

Now we can be surgical.

If you build an AI-powered GitHub security + vulnerability reasoning system, here is exactly where you can realistically compete — and where you should strategically apply.

I’ll divide this into:

🏆 High-probability wins

🎯 Strategic stretch targets

❌ Not worth targeting

🔥 How to shape the project to maximize prize surface area

🏆 High-Probability Fits
1️⃣ OpenAI – Artificial Intelligence Track

“Top three teams that use OpenAI API most creatively.”

This is a perfect fit if:

You use GPT-4o / reasoning models

Multi-file vulnerability reasoning

Exploit-chain generation

Patch diff generation

Security reasoning prompts

Judges here care about:

Creative API usage

Clever prompt orchestration

Agentic reasoning

If you build:

A repo-aware multi-step reasoning agent that models exploit chains

This is competitive.

2️⃣ Modal – Inference Track

This one is very strong for you.

If you:

Run repo embedding on Modal GPUs

Do scalable inference

Use Modal for structured pipeline

Optimize latency

Show cost-efficient scanning

You can pitch:

“We built a scalable AI security engineer running entirely on Modal.”

That hits their exact messaging.

And the prize is serious:

$5K Modal credits per person

Paid visit

Lunch with team

This is real infra builder territory.

Given your systems background → strong fit.

3️⃣ Greylock – Best Multi-Turn Agent

This is VERY strong if you design it properly.

They want:

Agent that reasons about feedback to dynamically complete complex, multi-step tasks

Security scanning is naturally multi-turn.

You can build:

Agent analyzes repo

Finds vulnerability

Simulates exploit

Refines reasoning

Proposes patch

Verifies patch fixes exploit

Iterates

That’s textbook multi-turn agent reasoning.

This might actually be your best sponsor challenge.

Courtside Warriors tickets + Greylock office hours is not small.

4️⃣ YC – Build an Iconic YC Company with AI

Now this is interesting.

Reframe your project as:

“Rebuilding GitHub Security for the AI era.”

Pick:

PagerDuty

GitHub itself

Snyk

Datadog

New Relic

And say:

If Snyk were built today with AI-native reasoning instead of static rules…

That fits perfectly.

And:
Guaranteed YC interview is extremely high value.

This is not just a prize — it’s leverage.

5️⃣ Neo – Most Likely to Become a Product

This is extremely aligned.

Neo explicitly wants:

Real product intuition

Founders who would commit long-term

An AI security tool:

Real problem

Huge market

Clear buyer (dev teams)

This is one of your strongest fits.

6️⃣ Human Capital Fellowship

This is massive.

$50k equity-free per person.

If you frame it as:

“We’re building autonomous security infrastructure for the AI-native software era.”

This absolutely qualifies as:

Massive problem

Generational company angle

This is high risk, high reward — but worth applying.

🎯 Strategic Stretch Targets
Elastic – Agentic system on Elasticsearch

If you:

Use Elastic

Index repo

Use JINA embeddings

Build RAG pipeline

You could qualify.

But this requires deliberate architecture choice.

Cloudflare – Best Use of Developer Platform

If you:

Deploy GitHub webhook scanner on Workers

Use Cloudflare storage

Use R2

Use Durable Objects

You could tailor it to this.

But only if infra is built that way.

Vercel – Best deployed on Vercel

If frontend is clean and deployed.

Easy to apply for this one.

Perplexity – Sonar API

Not ideal unless you integrate their reasoning engine directly.

❌ Not Worth Targeting

Healthcare

Sustainability

Commerce

Education

Voice AI healthcare

Music

Zoom

NVIDIA Edge (unless you do on-device scanning)

Hardware

Stay focused.

🔥 Maximum Prize Surface Strategy

You can apply for 10 prizes.

Here’s an optimized list:

OpenAI AI Track

Modal Inference Track

Greylock Multi-Turn Agent

YC Challenge

Neo Most Likely Product

Human Capital Fellowship

Elastic Agentic System

Cloudflare Dev Platform

Vercel Best Deployment

Most Technically Complex (auto)

Plus:

Grand Prize (auto)

Most Impactful (auto)

Most Creative (auto)

That’s serious coverage.

🧠 How to Architect It to Hit Multiple Tracks

Design it like this:

Core

Multi-turn security reasoning agent

Repo graph modeling

Exploit chain simulation

Patch generation

Infra

Inference on Modal

Repo indexed in Elastic

Webhook deployed on Vercel

Cloudflare for edge routing

Now suddenly:
You qualify for 6+ infra challenges naturally.

💡 Strategic Advice

Security AI tools are common.

To stand out:

Don’t build:

“AI that summarizes vulnerabilities.”

Build:

“Autonomous security engineer that reasons about attack surfaces.”

Key demo moment:

You show:

“Here is the exploit chain across 3 files.”
“Here is the attack payload.”
“Here is the patch.”
“Here is proof the exploit no longer works.”

If you do that clearly, you compete.

🚨 Hard Truth

This project only wins if:

It looks polished

The demo is crisp

You explain clearly

You don’t overscope

The biggest hackathon mistake is:
Trying to build too much infra.

You need:

Clean repo ingestion

Smart chunking

Focused reasoning loop

Clean UI

Strong demo narrative

If you want next step, we can:

Narrow the scope to something achievable in 36 hours

Design exact system architecture

Decide whether to optimize for YC vs Greylock vs OpenAI

Or pressure-test whether there’s an even stronger idea given this prize list

What’s your instinct — maximize prizes, or maximize long-term startup angle?

should we do it as a chrome extension? that you can just do it in your browser on any repo you're already on too

Yes — a Chrome extension is a strong choice for this if you use it to make the demo effortless.

When a Chrome extension is the right move

Do it as an extension if you want:

1-click UX: “Scan this repo” button right on GitHub

A wow demo: judges see it working on a real repo page instantly

Zero “paste URL / sign in / go to our site” friction

A clean story: “Security copilot lives where developers already are.”

This also makes you more credible for:

Neo (product)

YC challenge

Graphite “acquired by sponsor” (dev workflow tool)

When it’s not the right move

Avoid extension if:

You’ll burn 8–12 hours fighting Chrome extension plumbing + OAuth + CORS

You can’t deliver a clean backend anyway (extension alone can’t do heavy analysis)

You want to optimize for Modal Inference Track and need a polished compute pipeline more than UI flash

In practice: extension UI + backend compute is best.

Recommended architecture (hackathon-safe)

Extension = UI + context capture. Backend = brains.

Extension does:

Detect repo owner/name + current branch

Pull:

package.json, requirements.txt, Dockerfile, .github/workflows/*

“interesting” files (auth, config, crypto, request handlers)

Show results panel on GitHub:

Findings list

Exploit chain (if any)

Suggested patch diff

“Open PR” button (optional stretch)

Backend does:

Fast retrieval over repo (GitHub API)

Chunking + embeddings / indexing

Multi-turn agent reasoning

Generates structured JSON output for the extension UI

This keeps the extension lightweight and prevents you from getting stuck on GitHub rate limits / token issues inside the browser.

Prize implications

Chrome extension helps these a lot:

Neo – Most likely to become a product (it feels like a real workflow tool)

YC challenge (AI-native devtool)

Graphite acquired by sponsor (dev productivity + collaboration)

Greylock multi-turn agent (if your backend is an actual agent loop)

It doesn’t hurt:

OpenAI AI track (they’ll judge the intelligence)

Modal inference track (you can still run all inference on Modal)

Scope that’s actually doable in 36 hours

If you choose extension, keep it brutally minimal:

MVP (what you should ship)

Chrome extension injected into GitHub repo pages

“Scan repo” button

Backend returns:

Top 3 vulnerabilities with evidence snippets

One exploit chain (even if simulated)

Patch suggestion (diff-style text)

UI shows it cleanly

Stretch (only if ahead)

“Comment on PR” or “Open PR with patch”

Repository-wide call graph

Workflow misconfig detection

Secrets scanning

Key hackathon trick

Do not rely on user OAuth. It’s a time sink.

Instead:

Use a single team GitHub token on backend (from env var)

Only scan public repos for demo

If judges ask: “Private repos coming next.”

That saves hours.

My recommendation

Yes, do the Chrome extension if your goal is to win product/story/demo awards (Neo/YC/Graphite) and still be competitive elsewhere.

If your goal is purely technical/inference awards: a web app is simpler.
But extension + backend is the best overall hackathon weapon.

If you say “yes extension,” I’ll give you:

A concrete build plan (hour-by-hour)

Folder structure for extension + backend

Minimal API contract (JSON schema)

A demo script that sells it to judges in 60 seconds

should it be like a website then??

Website is the safer default for TreeHacks, and you can still make it feel “in-browser on any repo” without extension pain.

Here’s the decision rule:

Pick a website if you want to maximize “we will definitely ship”

Do a website if you want:

fastest path to a polished demo

no Chrome extension boilerplate / permissions / content scripts

easier deploy (Vercel / Render)

easier for sponsor judges to try it instantly

You can still have “works on any repo you’re on” via a bookmarklet:

user is on a GitHub repo page

clicks bookmarklet

it opens your site and passes the repo URL

site auto-runs scan

That gives you extension-like UX with ~5% of the hassle.

Pick a Chrome extension if you want maximum “wow” + workflow integration

Extension is worth it only if:

one of you is comfortable with extension dev already

you’ll keep it minimal (just button + side panel)

backend is already solid

What I’d do for a 36-hour hack

Website + bookmarklet.

It’s:

high polish

low risk

judges can click once and see results

still feels “native to GitHub”

Prize alignment (given your list)

Website hits:

OpenAI AI Track

Modal Inference Track

Greylock multi-turn agent

Neo product

YC challenge

Vercel best deployed (easy)

Cloudflare (optional)

Extension mostly adds:

stronger “product/workflow” vibe (Neo/Graphite)
…but costs time.

Minimal website flow that sells hard

Landing page: paste GitHub URL

“Scan” → results in <30–60s

Results page shows:

Top findings (with file/line + snippet)

Exploit chain diagram (even simple)

Patch diff (copy / apply)

Optional: “Generate PR” (stretch)

Concrete recommendation

Do website now, and if you finish early:

add extension wrapper Sunday morning (or just keep bookmarklet)

This is the highest probability of shipping something that wins.

If you tell me what stack you prefer (Next.js vs simple React, and Python FastAPI vs Node), I’ll give you a tight architecture + repo structure + API schema you can implement fast.

What is a good repo or set of todos to test it on

Good test repos are the ones where (a) there are real, known vulns, (b) the codebase is small enough to scan in a hackathon, and (c) the vuln types are diverse so your tool can show “reasoning,” not just pattern matching.

Best “one repo” to start with

OWASP Juice Shop (Node/JS)
Great for: auth flaws, injection-ish issues, insecure logic, lots of well-known intentionally vulnerable patterns.
Why it’s good: judges recognize it; you can demo fast.

Great intentionally-vulnerable training set (pick 2–4)
Web apps

WebGoat (Java)
Great for: SQLi, XSS, auth/session issues, access control.

DVWA (PHP)
Great for: classic web vulns; very fast wins.

RailsGoat (Ruby on Rails)
Great for: Rails-specific mistakes + auth/access control.

Node-specific (good if your scanner is JS-first)

Damn Vulnerable Node Application (DVNA)
Great for: modern Node/Express mistakes, auth, injection, misconfig.

Microservice-style (good for “attack chain” demos)

OWASP NodeGoat (Node/Express)
Great for: showing flow across routes/controllers → DB → auth.

Repos that are not intentionally vulnerable, but good for “realistic” scanning

Pick something popular-ish and medium sized so you can show “we found 1–2 real issues + risky patterns,” without needing a perfect exploit:

any small FastAPI demo app, Express demo, or Next.js starter with auth + DB
(These are good for detecting risky patterns, secrets, bad configs, etc.)

A tight “test todo list” for your scanner (what to verify it can do)

Start with these checks in this order (each one is demo-friendly):

Secrets & keys

.env, hardcoded API keys, AWS tokens, private keys, JWT secrets
Output: exact file path + redacted snippet + “what to rotate”.

Dependency risk

package-lock.json, requirements.txt, pom.xml, Gemfile.lock
Output: list top CVEs + whether it’s reachable (if you can).

Auth / access control logic

routes that look protected but aren’t
Output: “endpoint X lacks auth middleware; here’s the call path”.

Injection primitives

SQL queries built from strings

shell execution (exec, spawn, subprocess) with user input
Output: “source → sink” chain across files.

SSRF / unsafe URL fetch

requests.get(user_url) / fetch(user_url)
Output: why it’s exploitable + suggested allowlist / URL parsing fix.

GitHub Actions / CI misconfigs

.github/workflows/* risky pull_request_target, unpinned actions, curl | bash
Output: “supply chain risk” findings.

If your tool can do (3) or (4) with a real multi-file chain, that’s the “Greylock multi-turn agent” / “Most technically complex” moment.

How to structure your demo

Use 2 repos:

Juice Shop / NodeGoat / DVNA → guaranteed vulnerabilities (makes your tool look smart)

A “normal” small repo → shows real-world usefulness (makes it look like a product)

Quick check so I tailor this right: Maksym or Veronika? (Also: are you building the scanner JS-first, or language-agnostic?)

summarize the entire idea pls

Core idea (one paragraph):

Build an AI security copilot for GitHub repositories — a web app (optionally later a browser extension) that analyzes any public repo and behaves like an automated red-team engineer. A user pastes a repo URL, the system scans the codebase, reasons across multiple files using an LLM agent, identifies real security vulnerabilities, explains the exploit chain (how an attacker would actually abuse it), and generates a concrete patch or fix. The goal is not static linting, but AI reasoning about attack surfaces.

What the product does

User flow:

Paste GitHub repo link

Click Scan

System analyzes repo

Returns:

🔴 Top vulnerabilities

🔗 Attack/exploit chain across files

📍 Evidence (file + line snippets)

🛠 Suggested patch (diff-style fix)

(optional) PR-ready fix

What makes it different

Not:

regex scanners

CVE lookup tools

dependency audit wrappers

Instead:

builds a structural understanding of the repo

traces data flow (input → processing → dangerous sink)

uses a multi-turn AI agent to reason like a security engineer

explains why something is exploitable

Think:

“Copilot, but for security review.”

High-level architecture

Frontend (website):

paste repo → show results dashboard

Backend:

Pull repo via GitHub API

Select important files (auth, routes, configs, workflows)

Chunk + index code

AI agent loop:

hypothesize vulnerabilities

verify evidence

build exploit chain

propose fix

Return structured findings

Inference runs on cloud GPUs (Modal / Runpod).

Demo story (what judges see)

“Here’s a real repo.”

→ click scan
→ AI finds auth flaw across 3 files
→ shows attacker path
→ generates patch

Clear, fast, understandable.

Why it’s compelling

Huge real-world problem (software security)

Feels like a real startup product

Strong AI + systems angle

Works live on real code

Easy for judges to grasp in 30 seconds

One-line pitch

An autonomous AI security engineer that reviews any GitHub repo and finds real exploit paths — not just warnings.
